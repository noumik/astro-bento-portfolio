**Background:** Bike sharing programs are becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world. Motivate is the largest operator of these services in many major U.S. cities, including New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. They worked with researchers from Cornell University, Uber, and Lyft to develop a system for balancing the number of bikes at each docking station and creating a scheme to crowd-source the process. My paper broke down and analyzed the situation by proposing various models to solve each part of the problem.
