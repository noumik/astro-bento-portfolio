# Forensic Data Analysis

_The details and materials for this project are confidential. Below is a brief summary of the work._
<br><br>

**Background:** The Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating a major credit ratings firm for fraud related to commercial mortgage-backed securities. They provided extensive financial datasets containing the firm's records.
<br><br>
**Aim:**  The goal was to analyze the data to identify evidence of fraudulent activity towards consumers and present the findings in a clear, easy to understand format for the SEC's legal team.
<br><br>
**Action:** I used R and SQL to clean, simplify, and analyze the large datasets, identifying critical insights that supported the SECâ€™s case against the credit ratings firm.
<br><br>
**Result:** Following the presentation of our analysis to the SEC, the credit ratings firm reached a multi-million dollar settlement with the SEC.
