This analysis looked at how to expand Airbnb's market share in the Washington D.C. area.

Given a large amount of raw data from Airbnb, our team cleansed and analyzed it, then presented our recommendations.

Python was mainly used for removing irrelevant data and for creating visualizations. Libraries such as Plotly and Pandas were used.

Excel and SAS Visual Analytics were also used for creating visualizations.
