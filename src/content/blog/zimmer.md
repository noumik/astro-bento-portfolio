# Product Lifecycle Management — Oracle WMS

_The technical materials for this project are confidential. Below is a brief summary of the work._
<br><br>

**Background:** Zimmer Biomet develops and sells many medical device products across the world. They needed a more efficient way to manage their products, certificates, and regulatory documents.
<br><br>
**Aim:**  To streamline and improve the management of Zimmer Biomet’s product data, certificates, and regulatory documents, enhancing efficiency and ensuring compliance across global markets.
<br><br>
**Action:** I designed, developed, and led training sessions and demos for the implementation of a Windchill PLM solution at Zimmer Biomet, focusing on optimizing product lifecycle management, improving document control, and simplifying regulatory submission processes.
<br><br>
**Result:** The implementation of the Windchill PLM solution significantly increased operational efficiency, reduced errors in document management, and enhanced compliance tracking, ultimately saving time and reducing costs in regulatory and product lifecycle workflows.
