# Machine Vision

_The technical materials for this project are confidential. Below is a brief summary of the work._
<br><br>

**Background:** When a tire gets manufactured, a [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYzz2MaZo6A" style="color: lightblue;" target="_blank">Tire Building Machine</a>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYzz2MaZo6A) (TBM) cuts a long piece of rubber, with each piece intended for a single tire. However, various factors and external abnormalities that can cause the TBM to make cuts slightly too early or late, resulting in defective tires and material waste.
<br><br>
**Aim:** The goal of our team was to develop and implement an adaptive control system to  significantly reduced material waste caused by inaccurate cuts.
<br><br>
**Action:** We developed a program that automatically detects and predicts when the TBM cutter was making inaccurate cuts, and then automatically adjusts the machine accordingly in real-time to correct the issue. The analysis was performed using Python and the program was deployed through ThingWorx for implementation.
<br><br>
**Result:** At the plants where this system was implemented, a substantial reduction in rubber waste was achieved, contributing to improved efficiency and reduced material costs.
