While working at the DLCC, I worked on and completed several data analysis projects.
<br><br>

\- I used **SQL** to fetch data from the **VAN** database containing past voter and election data.

\- Using **Excel** and **Python**, the data was cleansed and manipulated to contain relevant and useful information.

\- The data team developed formulas for calculating voter persuasion cost and turnout. Based on this and polling data, we created a forecast model for several races in Virginia and New Jersey.

\- I utilized the mapping tool, **QGIS**, along with **HTML** and **CSS**, to visualize forecasts and analyses.

\- Based on these forecasts, the rest of the organization determined allocations for financial and political investments.

\- The party successfully gained majorities in many targeted states, including the Virginia and New Jersey legislatures, in the November 2019 election.
<br><br>
Most of the data is confidential. However, our forecasts ended up being highly accurate. The outcome, in terms of majority party control, of every state legislative body was correctly predicted.
