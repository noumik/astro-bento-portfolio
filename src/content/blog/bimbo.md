# Predictive Modeling & Logistics


</style>

**Background:** Bimbo Bakeries lost over $1 billion in the 2023 fiscal year due to missing product throughout their supply chain. The issue stemmed from difficulties in tracking finished products as they moved from the bakery, through distribution centers, and ultimately to stores.

**Aim:** The goal was to improve product tracking and inventory management to minimize losses and enhance operational efficiency across Bimboâ€™s supply chain.

**Action:** To address this challenge, we implemented Oracle's Warehouse Management System software at each factory throughout the country. The project involved not only the software implementation but also enhancing its functionality and leading comprehensive training sessions for factory employees and supervisors.

**Result:** The successful implementation and training resulted in reduced product scrap for Bimbo, helping to better track inventory and ultimately mitigate the financial losses from missing products. This solution contributed to improved efficiency and accountability within Bimbo's distribution and storage processes.

I also proposed and developed a program in Python to optimize resource management for the project, reducing client costs.
