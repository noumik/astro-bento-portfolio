# Data Visualization and Analytics

_The materials for this project are confidential. Below is a brief summary of the work._
<br>_Screenshots of the web app will be posted with permission from the client at a later time._
<br><br>

**Background:** The Austin FC Academy has a lot of performance data on players and matches, much of it stored in Excel spreadsheets. I reached out to the coaches to gain an understanding of how that data is collected and managed.
<br><br>
**Aim:**  I proposed building a streamlined data pipeline, creating a centralized database, and developing front-end interfaces for real-time data collection during matches and for analyzing and visualizing insights.
<br><br>
**Action:** Using SQL, I designed and managed the database, and built user-friendly front-end applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<br><br>
**Result:** The new system simplified data management processes, enabling more efficient analysis and the generation of actionable insights through visualizations, ultimately improving decision-making for the club.
<br><br>
Below are some sample analysis outputs. These analyses are fed into the dashboard to be displayed in an interactive, user-friendly manner. Names are changed here for privacy reasons.
